# vision-based-toe-walking-detection

file_sum.txt is the final results of everything
experiments.py is the main detection file
Others are simple calculation and file reading.

The dataset I used is [Zero-Occlusion-Object-Tracking-Data-Set](https://github.com/csbuja/Zero-Occlusion-Object-Tracking-Data-Set)

The report can be found [toe-walking detection](https://github.com/Kngslwang/vision-based-toe-walking-detection/blob/main/Vision-based%20toe-walking%20detection%20in%20unconscious%20condition.pdf)
